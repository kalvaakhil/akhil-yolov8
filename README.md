This project presents a way to detect vehicles, classify them, count the number of vehicles and estimate the speed of the vehicles that exceed the specified speed limit by using image processing techniques like OpenCV, and YOLOv8. This process of detection of vehicles is divided into several parts: 1) Image Acquisition, 2) Detecting of the vehicles, 3) Classifying the type of vehicles, 4) Counting of the vehicles, 5) Estimating the speed of the vehicles which exceeds the specified speed limit, 6) Display the output. The classification of vehicles is done by the size of the object detected by the algorithm.
